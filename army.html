        <h3>Trained in the Jedi ways</h3>

        <p> talk about how count dooku trained him 
           Count Dooku made General Grievous like I said before but He also made him as a person after his accident. He gave Grievous a purpose and supplied him with
            constant upgrades and repairs as a service for his continued hunting of Jedi. However Count Dooku also treats Grievous like what he is a war dog. General Grievous
            only really commands his army when he is needed to; he himself serves as an assassin while Count Dooku tells him what and where to attack. Count Dooku also
            doesn't have any personal relationship with Grievous. He is just very much Grievous's master; he tells him what to do, asks for a report when it's done and then
            tells him to do something else.

        <h3>The Sepretist product</h3>

        <h5>B-1 Battle Droids</h5>

        <p>explain how they relate to General Grievous and what jobs they do
            B-1 Battle droids or as they are usually called B-1's are the brunt of the separatist force and make up most of General Greivous's army. They are whatever he makes them
            pilots, security, firefighters any job that has to be done by someone B-1's have got your back. Few problems can't be fixed by throwing enough B-1's at it they're cheap
            to make and are expended abundantly. They're so easy to make that when Grievous enters a tirade he tends to "accidently" break a couple of droids who are responsible for
            his anger. Despite their lacking individuality B-1's most of the time have a can do kind of attitude and can be pretty funny at times.
        </p>

        <h5>B-2 battle Droids</h5>

        <p>explain how they relate to General Grievous and what jobs they do
           B-2 battle droids are sort of a more combat focused kind of droid. While B-1 have light and small hands and libs the B-2's have brouder shoulders and heads that in
            their torsoes so they don't get shot off. The weapons they have are also built into their bodies in the form of arm cannons. The B-2's have also deeper voices and
            their main job is still security and war tactics but they are the reinforcements and shock troops of General Greivous's army. Their personalities are quite
            comedic and they like to look out for B-1's acting in almost a big brother type of way.

        <h5>B-X commando Droid</h5>

        <p>explain how they relate to General Grievous and what jobs they do
           B-X commando droids are the special forces of the separatist army; they have the same exact weapons as the B-1's but have many more tools at their disposal. I'm talking
            about thermal detonators, toxic detonators, snipers, vibroblades that can defend against jedi attacks. they mostly work in small strike teams and raid
            Republic guarded outposts and other special areas. They can climb extremely well and have thermal vision when needed they are nearly never out classed in a situation
            and certainly not out gadgeted. 
        </p>

        <h5>Droideka</h5>

        <p>explain how they relate to General Grievous and what jobs they do
            Droideka's have a very unique design unlike any of the others on this list they stand with three legs and at any time can form into a living wheel. that rolls around
            wherever it needs to go until it unfolds and starts blasting. Droideka's are support units and they support by locking down a certain part of any area by the
            sheer amount of blaster fire they can release. Droidkas on top of being a movable turret have a force field around them that deflect blaster fire around them.
        </p>

        <h5>IG-100 MagnaGuard</h5>

        <p>explain how they relate to General Grievous and what jobs they do
            IG-100 MagnaGuards are the body guards of the separatist forces. They do a lot of guarding and they can jump really high to get close to anybody trying to hurt their target to defend.
            The MagnaGuards themselves have these pikes they use to combat enemies and stun them. They are mainly used as guards to help Greivous in expedition on as guards for high ranking officials.
            They can use a multitude of weaponry like bazookas and electro whips but mainly stick to pistols and their electro staffs. They can also survive having their head ripped off and are very
            durable because their core holds a massive battery.

        <h3>Nemesis</h3>

        <p> talk about General Kenobi 
            Obi-Wan Kenobi is the exact foil to General Grievous in personality and in fighting style. Jedi and Obi-wan Kenobi in relation believe their is no chaos or anger
           but that everything moves through the force they are basically space monks. General Grievous on the other hand is extremely hostile and by any means wishes to inflict
           the most amount of pain and vengeance on anyone and thing he comes across. In the fighting department Greivous has a very jumpy style and fights with a lot of faints and
           wonky movement to goat his opponent into attacking. He also at the same time applies a lot of pressure with strikes in every direction. While Kenobi's whole style is
           to wait until his opponent messes up to strike and to keep up an almost impenetrable defense. They also have a ying yang thing going on because every jedi's
           lightsaber color stands for something and Kenobi's stands for peace keeping and resolution to break up a fight rather than hurt anyone and Grievous is a direct result
           of not only Kenobi's inability but the Galactic Republic's inability to keep that promise.
