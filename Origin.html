      <H3>The making of General Grievous</H3> 

      <p> show the in canon makings of character 
        Before General Grievous became a hulking cyborg he was a very powerful Kaleesh warlord. The Kaleesh were a more primitive type of people rarely using guns they opted for 
        spears and swords. They were lacking technology and power but were happy.So when the Glatic republic arrived and asked them if they would like to join there grand alliance.
        The Kaleesh agreed but then came a problem who would be the ambassador for not only the Kaleesh but the planet one name arose Qymaen jai Sheelal aka General Grievous. 
        However Darth Sidious's right hand man Count Dooku had heard about the Glatic Republic and the Kaleesh's plans and had to stop one more planet from siding with the 
        Republic. So he crashed the ship Qymen was taking to Republic, wiped the Kaleesh of the face of their planet and rebuilt Qymen into a massive cyborg. When he awake 
        from the transformation Count Dooku had recited to the Kaleesh of how the Republic had crashed his ship and destroyed his people. Count Dooku had also told him
        how convenientlyt he had a position for Qymen now General Grievous to become the lead General of an army who would soon burn the republic capital to the ground. 
        General Grievous was practically jumping at the chance to enached revange upon the Glatic Republic and the rest was history.

      <p class = "StoryBoard"> explain the different General Grievous's 
        The best known version of General Greivous is in the 2005 movie The Revenge of the Sith. Were he serves as a more "twirly mustache" kind of villian
        not Really doing anything but Running away. This is because George Lucas had General Greivous be more of a side to the actual story and meat of the movie
        being Anakin's struggle to control his emotions and how he slowly falls to the dark side of the force. General Greivous gets no character devlopment what so 
        ever throught the course of the movie but because of how popular it is this is the one most people know him for.
