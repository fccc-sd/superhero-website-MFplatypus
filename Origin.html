      <H3>The making of General Grievous</H3> 

      <p> show the in canon makings of character 
        Before General Grievous became a hulking cyborg he was a very powerful Kaleesh warlord. The Kaleesh were a more primitive type of people rarely using guns they opted for 
        spears and swords. They were lacking technology and power but were happy.So when the Glatic republic arrived and asked them if they would like to join there grand alliance.
        The Kaleesh agreed but then came a problem who would be the ambassador for not only the Kaleesh but the planet one name arose Qymaen jai Sheelal aka General Grievous. 
        However Darth Sidious's right hand man Count Dooku had heard about the Glatic Republic and the Kaleesh's plans and had to stop one more planet from siding with the 
        Republic. So he crashed the ship Qymen was taking to Republic, wiped the Kaleesh of the face of their planet and rebuilt Qymen into a massive cyborg. When he awake 
        from the transformation Count Dooku had recited to the Kaleesh of how the Republic had crashed his ship and destroyed his people. Count Dooku had also told him
        how convenientlyt he had a position for Qymen now General Grievous to become the lead General of an army who would soon burn the republic capital to the ground. 
        General Grievous was practically jumping at the chance to enached revange upon the Glatic Republic and the rest was history.

      <H3>General Grievous in legends</H3>

      <p class = "StoryBoard"> explain the different General Grievous's 
        The best known version of General Greivous is in the 2005 movie The Revenge of the Sith. Were he serves as a more "twirly mustache" kind of villian
        not Really doing anything but Running away. This is because George Lucas had General Greivous be more of a side to the actual story and meat of the movie
        being Anakin's struggle to control his emotions and how he slowly falls to the dark side of the force. General Greivous gets no character devlopment what so 
        ever throught the course of the movie but because of how popular it is this is the one most people know him for.
        <br>
        <br>
        The General Greivous I am talking about and will be Refuring to thought the course of this websit is Genndy Tartakovsky's depiction of him. You see when George Lucas 
        was making the movies General Greivous in he asked cartoon network to run a mini series about the movie. It was basically an animated trailer to get people hyped up 
        for George's soon to come movie and who was directing the mini sires other than the Genndy Tartakovsky a vet in the business. So when it came to the episode about 
        General Greivous all George gave Genndy was he was a cyborg who hunted jedi and Genndy being a wiz in character creation made a full fleged antagonised out of
        General Greivous. He scares a group of jedi knowing their powers directly relate to their emotions and when fighting them tries to seprate them as to weaken their 
        overall power as a group. The differences of these characters are leauges apart but serve the same purpose they are both side antagonist's but one is just better

      <h3>Fear, Surprise and Intimidation</h3>

      <p> explain general Grievous's style of fighting abd why its so effective aginst jedi 
        General Greivous's style of fighting is one of the best non jedi ways of fight to fight a jedi period. Trained by Count Dooku on top of his way to deal with jedi 
        General Greivous was taught thee inner workings of jedi arts by Count Dooku who was a former Jedi. On top of that General Greivous was told about how Jedi and Sith's
        emotions can have an effect on their powers. He was also told by Count Dooku that only by using things like fear suprise and intimidation can he defeat the jedi. General 
        Greivous still excells in combat with non jedi becuse of his extrem size, very fast speed, durable outside layer, and sith training. However at the end of the day no 
        mater how hard Greivous trains he is not the best duliest but what he is good at is crowd control. Jumping from person to person with his long legs and 
        emense speed Greivous may not always beat a jedi but he is faster than them. He also uses his clawed feet to grab just about anything he can and if he can't. 
        He likes to kick and seprate opponets appart from each other. Other times Greivous finds weapons and objects to throw at jedi to obstruct their sight so they can't push 
        him back or grab and crush him with the force.   
      </p>

      <h3>A true collection</h3>

      <p> go over the trophies he takes from the jedi and his weakness against them 
        General Greivous is a great warrior and fighter but the best way to fight a jedi is having force powers yourself and Greivous is just not force sensative. 
        He is completely out of his leauge any time he fights a jedi in the episodes he is apart of in the mini sieres Greivous sometimes strugles aginst students of
        the force. Just because for a fraction of a second he messed up his offense and was caught off balance which for general greivouse's case can mean certain doom. 
        So every Jedi General Greivous takes out he takes their lightsaber as a trophy for his collection of weapons.
