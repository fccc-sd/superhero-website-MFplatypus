                <h4>George Foreman</h4>

                <p>
                    Standing at a menacing 6'4 with a 78 inch wing span the priest himself had knockout power in both hands
                    and then some. George relied on selective punches to win a fight instead of points speed or threw sheer
                    grit he held power. With that George had to have some defese with his main source of it being his height.
                    He would land a combination just to lean on his back foot moving his head away from the entire fight. 
                    George's other abilty was his smash punch which was thrown like a hook but his elbow wasen't extended
                    which for anybody else would be a death sentance but for someone of George's stature he could throw it
                    saftly. Their was one big caveat to George's style for it to work he used his range and Ron Lyle was 6'3. 
                </p>

                <h4>Ron Lyle</h4>

                <p>
                    Compared to George Ron is the same thing but a little smaller and a lot more rugged. He learned to box while
                    he was in prison and has an impeccable ability to adapted on the fly. two power punchers locked in a ring 
                    this is bound to be a short fight.

                <p>
                    At the start Ron sends a cross and it misses. The fight is a lot of jabs until the last 30 seconds he rocks
                    Foreman with another cross sending him on the run and to be saved by the bell.
